Salesforce Tower, inside and out
It’s 217 feet taller than the Transamerica Pyramid and 93 feet taller than Sutro Tower, but there’s more to Salesforce Tower than simple size. The high-rise set to open by January 2018 is an ambitious work of engineering, from the underground piles to the hazy artwork that will seem to float in the sky.

An illuminated crownArtist Jim Campbell has conceived a set of lighting installations for summit of the tower that, he writes, are intended to be “part of the building, not a superficial add-on.” This will include low-resolution imagery projected onto the crown’s perforated metal skin by 11,000 LED lights.

Sustainability
The tower is designed to reduce energy consumption in several ways – including angled sunshades to deflect overhead sunlight, and a ventilation system that pulls in outside air through vents at ceiling level, purifies it, and then releases it through ducts below each floor upwards into offices.

Structural coreHolds elevators, restroomsmechanical spaces and storage rooms

Seismic strengthTo keep the tower stable, 42 load-bearing piles were drilled as deep as 310 feet below ground level, anchored in bedrock.
